// Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement inversion of control (IoC) in software applications. Inversion of control means that the control of the flow of an application's execution is inverted compared to traditional programming models. Instead of the application calling a service or creating an object, the service or object is provided to the application.

// In Angular, DI is used to provide dependencies to components and services. A dependency is an object that a class or function needs in order to execute its responsibilities. By using DI, you can decouple the classes and functions in your application, making it easier to maintain and test.

// Here is an example of how DI is used in an Angular component:


import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MyService } from './my.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponent {

  constructor(private myService: MyService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.myService.doSomething();
  }

}

// In this example, the MyComponent component has a dependency on the MyService service. The MyService service is injected into the component's constructor, and the component can use it to perform operations.

// By using DI, you can easily change the implementation of the MyService service without having to modify the MyComponent component. This makes your application more flexible and easier to maintain.
